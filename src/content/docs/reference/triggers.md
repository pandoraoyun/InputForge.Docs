Triggers decide whether a processed value should cause an action to fire. They are evaluated **after** all modifiers have been applied.

Assign triggers to an `InputMapping` via the `LocalTriggers` array in the Inspector. Multiple triggers use **OR logic** — if any trigger returns true, the action fires.

## Default Triggers

When `LocalTriggers` is empty, a default trigger is selected based on `InputType`:

| InputType                              | Default trigger    | Behaviour                        |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| `Boolean`                              | `TriggerOnKeyDown` | Fires on the first press frame   |
| `Digital`, `Analog`, `Delta`, `Pointer`| `TriggerOnChange`  | Fires whenever the value changes |

---

## TriggerOnKeyDown

Fires **once** on the rising edge — the first frame the value becomes non-zero. Does not fire while the input is held or when it is released.

No configurable properties.

Use for: jump, attack, interact — anything that should happen exactly once per press.

---

## TriggerOnKeyUp

Fires **once** on the falling edge — the first frame the value returns to zero.

No configurable properties.

Use for: charged attacks (release to fire), toggle-on-release, hold-and-release mechanics.

---

## TriggerOnChange

Fires whenever the value differs from the previous event's value. This includes both transitions to non-zero and back to zero.

No configurable properties.

This is the default for axis mappings because it ensures that releasing a key sends a zero value to the subscriber, correctly stopping movement or resetting velocity.

---

## TriggerContinuous

Fires while the value is non-zero. Has two modes, controlled by the `Pulse` flag.

| Property        | Description                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Pulse`         | When off (default), fires on every event while non-zero. When on, throttles to one fire per `PulseInterval`.  |
| `PulseInterval` | Seconds between pulses while the value is held non-zero. Only shown when `Pulse` is enabled. Lower = faster.  |

**Default mode (`Pulse` off):** fires on every event while the value is non-zero — use for per-event accumulation like building up charge.

**Pulse mode (`Pulse` on):** fires at most once every `PulseInterval` seconds while the input is held. The first event of a fresh hold fires immediately, then subsequent fires are spaced by the interval; releasing the input (value returns to zero) resets the timer so the next press fires right away. Use for repeat-fire weapons, held-button repeats, or step-wise scrolling.

The pulse cadence is measured in real time (`Time.GetTicksMsec`), not by counting events or frames — event arrival rate isn't constant, so a wall-clock interval is the only stable measure. It still relies on events arriving to be evaluated.

Note: for Digital input, OS key-repeat events are filtered by `InputKey`, so on a held key this trigger only re-evaluates when the axis value changes. Pulse mode is most predictable with input that streams events continuously (mouse motion, analog axes). For frame-perfect continuous input regardless of event flow, consider polling `Input.IsKeyPressed` in `_Process` instead.

## Writing a Custom Trigger

Extend `InputTrigger` and override `Evaluate`:

```csharp
using Godot;
using InputForge.Triggers;

/// <summary>Fires only when the value exceeds a threshold.</summary>
[GlobalClass]
public sealed partial class TriggerOnThreshold : InputTrigger
{
    [Export] public float Threshold { get; set; } = 0.8f;

    public override bool Evaluate(Vector3 value, InputEvent @event)
        => value.Length() >= Threshold;
}
```

If your trigger holds edge/change state (a "previous value" between events), override `Reset()` to clear it — InputForge calls `Reset()` on every active-context change so a shadowed trigger never carries stale state across a context switch.
